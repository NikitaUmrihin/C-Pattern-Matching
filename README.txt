The algorithm matches multiple patterns simultaneously, by first constructing a
Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) representing the patterns set, and then, with
this DFA on its disposal, processing the text in a single pass.

Specifically, the DFA construction is done in two phases. First, the algorithm builds a
DFA of the patterns set: All the patterns are added from the root as chains, where each
state corresponds to one symbol. When patterns share a common prefix, they also
share the corresponding set of states in the DFA.

The edges of the first phase are called forward transitions. Thses transitions are
represented by the Goto function, g(state,symbol)â†’state.
Each state corresponds to a label; the label is the sequence of characters on its goto
path from the root. The length of the label is the depth of the state.
The DFA has Regular states and accepting states.

The edges of the second phase are called failure transitions. These edges deal with
situations where, given an input symbol b and a state s, there is no forward transition
from s using b. In such a case, the DFA should follow the failure transition to some
state s' and take a forward transition from there (The failure transition from s is always
to a state s', whose label L(s') is the longest suffix of L(s) among all other DFA states).
This process is repeated until a forward transition is found.
